# kellen-index
The Kellen Index is a mathematical model developed by Alex Jagrowski and Liam Jagrowski for quantitatively describing the amount of uncertainty in an NCAA tournament.

# background
Our younger brother Kellen is notorious for his straightforward way of filling NCAA brackets. Kellen simply picks the higher-seeded team (unless one of the teams is Michigan, in which case Michigan is always picked).

Kellen's simple way of selecting winners does suggest an interesting question: can we develop a model to describe the amount of "chaos" in NCAA tournaments?
The 2018 tournament, for example, was clearly extremely chaotic: 1 seed and tournament favorite Virginia lost in the first round to 16 seed UMBC. The final four ended up including 11 seed Loyola Chicago. The purpose of developing the Kellen index is to numerically describe this level of chaos.
